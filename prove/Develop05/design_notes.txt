ETERNAL QUESTION 
This is a program that does the gamification of
life activities like I've been wanting to create for
a while 


Potential classes:
user (tracks points)
goals (number of points, is completed)
- simple goal (complete once)
- eternal goal (complete infinite times)
- checklist goal (complete a set number of times, which bonus at end)
menu
- METHODS:
    create goal
    list goals
    save goals
    load goals
    record event
    quit

other:
- file to save goals (and point)



Program additions:
- statistic (abstract class for a statistic a
    player's statistic might have, for example, 
    halflife, max points, etc.)
- user class also tracks statistics
- goal classes also track statistic points
- file to save user stats (multiple users?)
- interface? O: 
- JSON? O: (professor gave up so... maybe not this)
- Points store (you create your own items to spend points on!)
- Store item recommendation random generator (AI generates based on what it
    knows about you)
- Some goals can be completed once every x time length
- Dynamic goals list that changes based on status of player
