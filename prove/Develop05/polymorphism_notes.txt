ABSTRACT
- Cannot create as an object
- The method that is abstract MUST be overwritted in the 
    child class
- Refers to a class that contains an abstract method
- also refers to method that is abstract (does not contain
    default code)

VIRTUAL
- Virtual class CAN be created as an object
- Method will exist in all child classes and does not need
    to be overwritten to use


A lot of the value of abstract classes and methods are idiot-proofing.
In other words, you are the idiot. 
It ensures that EVERY child class does, in fact, contain that method
even if you forgot, because it won't let you run unless you have
included that method for the child class.
